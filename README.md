# dotfiles

Configuration files and scripts for my Linux system.

There are configuration files for:

- Bash (Shell)
- Git (VCS)
- Neovim (Editor)
- Zathura (PDF Viewer)

## Usage

Once the repository has been cloned, the dotfiles can be installed by running
`./install.sh`. This will create symlinks for each of the configuration files
assuming there is not already a file present.
